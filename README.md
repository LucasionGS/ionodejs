# IonodeLib (For Node.js)
IonLib is a collection of code that I use in my own software or websites to make my life easier. And so can you.

This one uses Node.js modules and therefore cannot be used in regular webpage javascript. This is meant to be used along side something like `Electron`

For standard javascript, check out [IonLib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionodelib) instead ([Github](https://github.com/LucasionGS/IonLibJs))
